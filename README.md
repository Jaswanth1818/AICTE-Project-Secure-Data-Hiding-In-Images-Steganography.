**Secure-Data-Hiding-In-Images-Steganography**.
The Image-Based Steganography Tool is a Python-powered application that enables users to securely hide messages within images using AES encryption and LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography. The tool provides both encoding and decoding functionality through an intuitive Streamlit-based UI.
🖼️ Image-Based Steganography Tool  

The Image-Based Steganography Tool** is a Python application that allows users to hide messages inside images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography**. The tool provides both encoding and decoding functionality through a Tkinter-based GUI.

 ⭐ Features  

- 🖼️ LSB Steganography: Hides secret messages in images at the pixel level.  
- 🔑 Passcode Protection: Messages are stored along with a passcode for basic security.  
- 📤 Image Upload & Download: Users can upload images, encode/decode messages, and save encrypted images.  
- 🛠️ User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive experience.  

🛠 How to Use  

🔵 Encoding a Message  
1. Select a PNG/JPG image.  
2. Enter your **secret message**.  
3. Provide a **passcode** (used for retrieval).  
4. Click **"Select Image & Encrypt"** to save the image with the hidden message.  

 🟢 Decoding a Message  
1. Select the **steganographic image**.  
2. Enter the **correct passcode**.  
3. Click **"Select Image & Decrypt"** to reveal the message.  

 👨‍💻 Technologies Used  

- Python 🐍  
- Tkinter – For GUI  
- Pillow (PIL) – For image handling  
- Stepic – For encoding and decoding messages  

 🚀 Future Enhancements  

- Support for additional image formats and higher resolution images  
- Extend functionality to **video steganography**  
- Develop a **web-based or mobile application** for broader accessibility  
- Implement **stronger encryption methods** for added security
